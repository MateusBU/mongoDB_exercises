MongoDB Basic Commands Explained
================================

1. show dbs
-----------
Description:
Lists all databases currently available on the MongoDB server.

Note:
A database will only appear here after it contains some data (e.g., a collection or document).

2. use mongoDb
--------------
Description:
Switches the context to the 'mongoDb' database.

Note:
If the database does not exist yet, MongoDB will create it automatically when you insert data or create a collection.

3. db.createCollection('states')
-------------------------------
Description:
Creates a new collection named 'states' in the current database.

Note:
A collection in MongoDB is similar to a table in relational databases.

4. show collections
-------------------
Description:
Displays all collections within the current database.

Note:
Just like databases, collections only appear once they contain data or are explicitly created.

5. db.States.drop()
-------------------
Description:
Attempts to delete the 'States' collection.

Important:
MongoDB is case-sensitive. If the collection was created as 'states', then 'db.States.drop()' will NOT work.
Use 'db.states.drop()' instead.

Return Values:
- true  → collection was deleted.
- false → collection not found or not deleted.

Additional Notes
----------------
- All commands are run inside the MongoDB shell (mongosh).
- MongoDB creates databases and collections lazily (only when data is inserted).
